wget2 (2.0.0~pre0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
  * Add autogen because working from snapshot.
  * Scratch that; manually run
    ./bootstrap
    autoreconf --force --install --symlink --warnings=all
    and then make a tarball by hand, instead of using "git archive".

  * FTBFS2 because "make distclean; make distclean" is broken upstream
  * FTBFS2 because po/*.po change, because they're not part of git, but
    rather are downloaded for a different source version from 
    https://translationproject.org/latest/wget2/.

  * Add libzstd-dev dependency.
  * Add libmicrohttpd-dev for "make test".  Is this a bad idea?
  * FIXME: can't add libhsts-dev dependency -- not in Debian!
    In wget2 1.99.2, this was in-house.
    Now it is spun off into a separate library.
    Until Debian has that library

  * Add usr/share/locale to wget2 (FIXME: wget2-common?)

  * Ship the *.a and *.la files
